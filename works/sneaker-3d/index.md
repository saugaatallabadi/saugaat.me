This is a chat service for hoteliers to communicate with their guests instantly & seamlessly. AutoInvite Chat is designed with both guests’ and hotel agents’ ease of use in mind: Guests can just send a text message, and hoteliers will be able to manage and reply to all requests and questions from a single screen, in real-time.

During the design phase, I collaborated with several hotels to create the perfect user interface that serves their needs. I built AutoInvite Chat front-end from the ground up using React for an optimal performance.

We’ve released AutoInvite Chat as part of SwayPay in 2020.
